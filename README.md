## About the Project

SafeGlide is an **AI-powered adaptive airbag system** designed to make emergency aircraft landings survivable.

While 70% of survivable aviation accidents involve hard landings or runway overruns, existing systems focus on preventing crashes — not minimizing impact when they do occur.

SafeGlide bridges this gap by deploying an under-fuselage airbag raft in **under 150 milliseconds**, reducing peak G-forces by up to 50% and stabilizing the aircraft to prevent rollovers and secondary crashes.

Developed for the **International Innovation Hackathon 2.0 (Space & Aerotech Innovation Track)**.

## How It Works

SafeGlide uses a three-step adaptive safety mechanism powered by real-time sensor fusion and predictive AI models:

1. **Sense** – Monitors descent speed, angle, altitude, and gear behavior using radar altimeters & IMUs.
2. **Decide** – AI anomaly detection identifies unsafe landing scenarios within milliseconds.
3. **Act** – High-pressure inflators deploy the adaptive airbag raft in under 150 ms.
